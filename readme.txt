Brief description of project:

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proven to perform better than traditional neural networks due to the nature of graphs capturing relations between entities of different types and granularity.
One of the main goals of neural graphs is to produce a prediction by considering the graph level achieved via counting graphlets. Since the current implementations of counting graphlets are computationally expensive,
we target to implement an efficient graphlet counting method for an algorithm like the Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernel algorithm. 
We will develop a HIP program for optimizing graphlet counting computations on a target AMD GPU device to obtain more computationally efficient performance.
